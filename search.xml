        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Today, I tried to remove the graphic card fron my old computer, which uses xeon e3 1230v2, which does not contain a core graphics card and need a discrete gpu to light up, i installed a freenas on it, which has no gui, remotely controlled through web page.</p><p> After i removed the gpu, i plugged another pcie2nvme card with a samsung sm961 on it to the finally-free slot and boot it. It succeeded, and i can normally add the new sm961 to my zfs pool.</p><p> Though i know that many hardware like routers, like ssd controllers, don’t have a video output and they can function well, but on pc hardware, i see it for the first time. And i searched for it, it says, some old pc boards dosen’t support booting without video outputs, the support starts from these years.</p><p> And now i have a useless gtx750ti, i think i’m ready to melt it into nails.  :)</p>]]></content>
