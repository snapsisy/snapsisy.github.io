OpenCV core modules"></a>2. OpenCV core modules</h2><p>(continue from where we left)</p><p>In the second part, the topic is about some basic operations of images and pixels.</p><p>Such as:</p><pre><code>- Look-Up-Table- Mask operations- Basic operations- Blending- DFT- Changing contrast and brightness</code></pre><a id="more"></a><h3 id="2-2-Look-Up-Table-and-other-image-scanning-functions"><a href="#2-2-Look-Up-Table-and-other-image-scanning-functions" class="headerlink" title="2.2.

Test case"></a>2.2.1. Test case</h4><p>In this paragraph we will talk about LUT and other ways to go through images. We use a color space reduction example to demonstrate the differences.</p><p>First, we make a rule for color reduction that represents as</p><p>$${I_{new}} = ( \frac {I_{old}} {10} ) * {10} $$</p><p>Then, if we pick up the 3rd parameter of cmd to be the value to reduce, we can have the following code:</p><pre><code>int divideWith = 0; // convert our input string to number - C++ stylestringstream s;s &lt;&lt; argv[2];s &gt;&gt; divideWith;if (!s || !divideWith){    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Invalid number entered for dividing. &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;    return -1;}uchar table[256];for (int i = 0; i &lt; 256; ++i)   table[i] = (uchar)(divideWith * (i/divideWith));</code></pre><p>We will also take the system function to measure the excutioning time for each method. Shown as below:</p><pre><code>double t = (double)getTickCount();// do something ...t = ((double)getTickCount() - t)/getTickFrequency();cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Times passed in seconds: &quot; &lt;&lt; t &lt;&lt; endl;</code></pre><p>And let’s learn more about how the image matrix is stored in memory.</p><h4 id="2-2-2-Matrix-storage"><a href="#2-2-2-Matrix-storage" class="headerlink" title="2.2.2. Matrix storage"></a>2.2.2. Matrix storage</h4><p>Because in many cases the memory is large enough to store the rows in a successive fashion the rows may follow one after another, creating a single long row. Because everything is in a single place following one after another this may help to speed up the scanning process. We can use the cv::Mat::isContinuous() function to ask the matrix if this is the case.</p><h4 id="2-2-3-C-pointers-–-the-most-efficient-system-operation"><a href="#2-2-3-C-pointers-–-the-most-efficient-system-operation" class="headerlink" title="2.2.3. C pointers – the most efficient system operation"></a>2.2.3. C pointers – the most efficient system operation</h4><pre><code>Mat&amp; ScanImageAndReduceC(Mat&amp; I, const uchar* const table){    // accept only char type matrices    CV_Assert(I.depth() == CV_8U);    int channels = I.channels();    int nRows = I.rows;    int nCols = I.cols * channels;    if (I.isContinuous())    {        nCols *= nRows;        nRows = 1;    }    int i,j;    uchar* p;    for( i = 0; i &lt; nRows; ++i)    {        p = I.ptr&lt;uchar&gt;(i);        for ( j = 0; j &lt; nCols; ++j)        {            p[j] = table[p[j]];        }    }    return I;}</code></pre><p>In this code slice, we combine the channels into rows, and use a pointer to go over all the elements in one row in one time, during which we assign the new color-reduced value to it. We can also use another method, benefiting from the feature of <em>data</em> data.</p><pre><code>uchar* p = I.data;for( unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; ncol*nrows; ++i)*p++ = table[*p];</code></pre><p>This is the case of grayscale image. We don’t need to triple the elements that we go through in one row.</p><h4 id="2-2-4-Iterator"><a href="#2-2-4-Iterator" class="headerlink" title="2.2.4. Iterator"></a>2.2.4. Iterator</h4><p>In this method, the iterator take away the risk that users can’t accurately assign enough <em>uchar</em> items, or to skip the gap correctly between the rows. We can use a simple ‘*’ to access every value.</p><pre><code>Mat&amp; ScanImageAndReduceIterator(Mat&amp; I, const uchar* const table){    // accept only char type matrices    CV_Assert(I.depth() == CV_8U);    const int channels = I.channels();    switch(channels)    {    case 1:        {            MatIterator_&lt;uchar&gt; it, end;            for( it = I.begin&lt;uchar&gt;(), end = I.end&lt;uchar&gt;(); it != end; ++it)                *it = table[*it];            break;        }    case 3:        {            MatIterator_&lt;Vec3b&gt; it, end;            for( it = I.begin&lt;Vec3b&gt;(), end = I.end&lt;Vec3b&gt;(); it != end; ++it)            {                (*it)[0] = table[(*it)[0]];                (*it)[1] = table[(*it)[1]];                (*it)[2] = table[(*it)[2]];            }        }    }    return I;}</code></pre><p>To access the n-th sub column we use simple operator[] access. OpenCV iterators go through the columns and automatically skip to the next row. Therefore in case of color images if you use a simple uchar iterator you’ll be able to access only the blue channel values.(BGR for the one cell three items).</p><h4 id="2-2-5-On-the-fly-address-calculation-with-reference-returning"><a href="#2-2-5-On-the-fly-address-calculation-with-reference-returning" class="headerlink" title="2.2.5. On-the-fly address calculation with reference returning"></a>2.2.5. On-the-fly address calculation with reference returning</h4><p>This method is for random access of values.</p><pre><code>Mat&amp; ScanImageAndReduceRandomAccess(Mat&amp; I, const uchar* const table){    // accept only char type matrices    CV_Assert(I.depth() == CV_8U);    const int channels = I.channels();    switch(channels)    {    case 1:        {            for( int i = 0; i &lt; I.rows; ++i)                for( int j = 0; j &lt; I.cols; ++j )                    I.at&lt;uchar&gt;(i,j) = table[I.at&lt;uchar&gt;(i,j)];            break;        }    case 3:        {         Mat_&lt;Vec3b&gt; _I = I;         for( int i = 0; i &lt; I.rows; ++i)            for( int j = 0; j &lt; I.cols; ++j )               {                   _I(i,j)[0] = table[_I(i,j)[0]];                   _I(i,j)[1] = table[_I(i,j)[1]];                   _I(i,j)[2] = table[_I(i,j)[2]];            }         I = _I;         break;        }    }    return I;}</code></pre><p>The function takes your input type and coordinates and calculates the address of the queried item. Then returns a reference to that. Compared to the efficient way in release mode the only difference in using this is that for every element of the image you’ll get a new row pointer for what we use the C operator[] to acquire the column element.</p><p>If you need to do multiple lookups using this method for an image it may be troublesome and time consuming to enter the type and the at keyword for each of the accesses. To solve this problem OpenCV has a cv::Mat_ data type.this is easily convertible from and to the usual cv::Mat data type. </p><h4 id="2-2-6-LUT"><a href="#2-2-6-LUT" class="headerlink" title="2.2.6. LUT"></a>2.2.6. LUT</h4><p>OpenCV provides a function for modifying image values, without the need to write the scanning logic of the image. We use the cv::LUT() function of the core module.</p><p>First we build a Mat type of the lookup table:</p><pre><code>Mat lookUpTable(1, 256, CV_8U);uchar* p = lookUpTable.ptr();for( int i = 0; i &lt; 256; ++i)    p[i] = table[i];</code></pre><p>Finally call the function (I is our input image and J the output one):</p><pre><code>LUT(I, lookUpTable, J);</code></pre><h4 id="2-2-7-Result"><a href="#2-2-7-Result" class="headerlink" title="2.2.7. Result"></a>2.2.7. Result</h4><p>In a quite large (2560 X 1600) image:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Efficient Way</td><td>79.4717 milliseconds</td></tr><tr><td>Iterator</td><td>83.7201 milliseconds</td></tr><tr><td>On-The-Fly RA</td><td>93.7878 milliseconds</td></tr><tr><td>LUT function</td><td>32.5759 milliseconds</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The fastest method turns out to be the LUT function. This is because the OpenCV library is multi-thread enabled via Intel Threaded Building Blocks. However, if you need to write a simple image scan prefer the pointer method. The iterator is a safer bet, however quite slower. Using the on-the-fly reference access method for full image scan is the most costly in debug mode. In the release mode it may beat the iterator approach or not, however it surely sacrifices for this the safety trait of iterators.</p><h4 id="TO-BE-CONTINUED"><a href="#TO-BE-CONTINUED" class="headerlink" title="TO BE CONTINUED"></a>TO BE CONTINUED</h4>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been learning machine vision for a few days. But not until today do i decide to write something about it.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="1-Machine-Vision-amp-Computer-Vision"><a href="#1-Machine-Vision-amp-Computer-Vision" class="headerlink" title="1.Machine Vision&amp; Computer Vision"></a>1.Machine Vision&amp; Computer Vision</h2><p>First, I want to talk about Machine Vision and Computer Vision.</p><p>Although, there is a slight (at least in my understading) difference between MV and CV. It’s that machine vision focuses more on the process of getting the images or videos. It has a requirement of nearly 100% correctness on the results. People making studies in this field focuses on optimizing the devices capturing the vision information. While CV concentrates more on image processing, and the storage and usage of image data.<br>Nowadays, the image capturing devices are getting more and more electronical, MV is much closer to Computer Vision, for it needs the CV algorithms, AI and so on to optimize its data source. Meanwhile, CV also need to care about the conventional things like in CV, for it’s also important for CV to have a more explicit ‘VISION’. The differences between them is shrinking.</p><p>As is shown above, besides the vast amount of image processing algorithms, yet we still need to get familiar with the topics of illumination, lenses, cameras, interfaces between cameras and computers, along with 3D sensors. And in the next post (after OpenCV core module), i will talk about different ways of illumination.</p><h2 id="2-OpenCV-core-modules"><a href="#2-OpenCV-core-modules" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenCV core modules"></a>2. OpenCV core modules</h2><p>OpenCV is a very popular library in computer vision. It has interfaces for c(deprecated but suppported while not suggested)/c++, Python(very popular and easy to learn), Java, etc. And it can run on Windows/Linux Distros(including android of course)/macOS/iOS.</p><p>About the installation on different platforms, I will make a video about it and upload it to bilibili.com later on. And i will emit this part in this post.</p><p>The platform i chose for myself is Windows + Visual Studio 2019, using vc14 compiler for c++. Which is a normal combination for industial usages.</p><h3 id="2-1-Mat"><a href="#2-1-Mat" class="headerlink" title="2.1. Mat"></a>2.1. Mat</h3><h4 id="2-1-1-Mat-construction-and-destruction"><a href="#2-1-1-Mat-construction-and-destruction" class="headerlink" title="2.1.1. Mat construction and destruction"></a>2.1.1. Mat construction and destruction</h4><p>First of all, we need to make it clear that images are stored in computers in the form of matrix. Using digits to represent every pixel that you see.</p><p>And you will not be surprised that Mat is a very important class in OpenCV, for it is how the image is stored in your computer. Normally, it’s composed of two parts, the header part and the body part. The header part stores some information of the image matrix, like what kind of image it is. And it has a constant size. As for the body part, it stores a reference to the real data of the image, which is a matrix, like i mentioned before.<br>You may wonder why it uses a reference rather than the whole matrix. Imaging that you need to assign the value to many Mat objects. And the COPY CONSTRUTOR of the class will assign every thousands of values each time you initialize a Mat object. It wastes a lot of time. So using the reference is a very effective way of fetching the matrix you need. But it’s also dangerous. Because if you change the value of the matrix through the object, you will change the raw matrix. Thus OpenCV also makes functions for you to fully create a new Mat object copying all the values.<br>And we will take a look at several ways of initializing a Mat object.</p><pre><code>Mat A, C;                          // declaration, which just creates the header parts without assigning valuesA = imread(argv[1], IMREAD_COLOR); // read in a image in color mode, file path specified by the first argumentMat B(A);                          // Use the copy constructorC = A;                             // Use the assignment operator</code></pre><p>In image processing, we usually have the concept of ROI, region of interest, thus we can also assign part of a image to the object.</p><pre><code>Mat D (A, Rect(10, 10, 100, 100) ); // using a rectangleMat E = A(Range::all(), Range(1,3));// using row and column boundaries</code></pre><p>Finally, the copy functions:</p><pre><code>Mat F = A.clone();Mat G;A.copyTo(G);</code></pre><p>Some of you may wonder that, since we have the creation method, do we have the destructor functions like ~Mat() ?<br>The answer is yes, but you don’t need to call it on your own, because the library has automatic memory management. When it finds that in the later execution you don’t need the Mat any more, and the matrix is not referenced to by any Mat, they will be deleted. which is realized by the reference counter method, which is a very common way of memory management.</p><h4 id="2-1-2-storing-methods"><a href="#2-1-2-storing-methods" class="headerlink" title="2.1.2. storing methods"></a>2.1.2. storing methods</h4><p>Images can be stored in many methods like RGB, HSV, HSL and so on. In OpenCV, we specify it when we read in the image using imread. and we can transforme it to other format using ‘cvtColors’ function. We will talk about this in image operations.</p><h4 id="2-1-3-manually-create-a-Mat-object"><a href="#2-1-3-manually-create-a-Mat-object" class="headerlink" title="2.1.3. manually create a Mat object"></a>2.1.3. manually create a Mat object</h4><p>The Mat constructor can also be used here as a fucntion which has tons of overrides:</p><pre><code>Mat M(2,2, CV_8UC3, Scalar(0,0,255));</code></pre><p>or</p><pre><code>int sz[3] = {2,2,2};Mat L(3,sz, CV_8UC(1), Scalar::all(0));</code></pre><p>and manually with the create() function:</p><pre><code>M.create(4,4, CV_8UC(2));</code></pre><p>Also some specific matrix types:</p><pre><code>Mat E = Mat::eye(4, 4, CV_64F);Mat O = Mat::ones(2, 2, CV_32F);Mat Z = Mat::zeros(3,3, CV_8UC1);</code></pre><p>The CV_{digit}{type}C{channel} format specifies the structure of the Mat object, which means in each position of the matrix, it has a {channel} channel number of {digit} digits, of specific {type} like int, float, and so on.</p><p>There are also some other operations like reshape and instream:</p><pre><code>C = (Mat_&lt;double&gt;({0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0})).reshape(3);Mat C = (Mat_&lt;double&gt;(3,3) &lt;&lt; 0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0);</code></pre><h4 id="2-1-4-output-formatting"><a href="#2-1-4-output-formatting" class="headerlink" title="2.1.4. output formatting"></a>2.1.4. output formatting</h4><p>You can output the Mat in many ways(not demonstrate the image, just showing the value of each pixel). You can use a formatter like:</p><pre><code>format({Mat M}, Formatter::FMT_PYTHON\FMT_CSV\FMT_NUMPY\FMT_C)</code></pre><h4 id="TO-BE-CONTINUED"><a href="#TO-BE-CONTINUED" class="headerlink" title="TO BE CONTINUED"></a>TO BE CONTINUED</h4>]]></content>

Jail first appear in BSD flavor unix. And after you create a jail or more, you can add different plugins for each jail, and different jails won’t affect echo other. So you can create a gitlab local server in one jail and a ftpserver in another.<br>But you need to have a pool to create a jail first.</p><p>A pool is a virtual storage device in zfs. It’s like a windows volumn in some ways, but the volumn can include multiple storage devices. You can keep adding sotrage devices to a pool, but i don’t know if it has a restriction to the amount of devices. And note that the system will be installed to a boot pool which it creates itself, so remember to use a fast but small flash storage device to install the system, for that the boot pool won’t be used to do anything and the space will be wasted, in another way it affects the system program performance.<br>We will talk about raid-z in the next post.
